**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Status:** On Track / MVP Core Ready

---

### 🚀 What I Achieved Today

#### 1. Product & Spec Alignment
- **Branding & Vision**: Finalized the "StoryCore-Engine" identity and unified the project vocabulary.
- **Architecture**: Established a "Determinism-First" pipeline, ensuring every generation is traceable and reproducible.

#### 2. Core Innovation: The Coherence Loop
- **Master Coherence Sheet**: Implemented the 3x3 grid anchor concept to solve the AI video consistency problem.
- **Pipeline Logic**: Defined the full workflow: `Master Grid → Slicing → Promotion → QA → Autofix → Export`.

#### 3. Jury-Facing Dashboard (Standalone HTML)
- **Technical Control Surface**: Created `storycore-dashboard-demo.html`, a high-fidelity standalone interface.
- **Key Features**:
    - **3x3 Master Grid**: Interactive panel selection with status indicators (OK / Processing / Auto-Fixed).
    - **QA Metrics**: Integrated sharpness proxy analysis (Laplacian variance).
    - **Autofix Logs**: Visualized "Before vs. After" improvements with delta scores (+29.5 improvement example).
    - **Manual Override**: Parameter sliders and "Manual Re-Promote" controls for human-in-the-loop validation.

#### 4. Validation & Testing
- **Frictionless Testing**: Added a feature to manually inject local images into the "BEFORE" slot for instant jury evaluation.
- **UI Separation**: Clearly distinguished between the **Technical Dashboard** (Proof of Intelligence) and the **Creative Studio** (Final User Experience).

### 📦 Concrete Deliverables
- [x] **Interactive Demo**: `storycore-dashboard-demo.html` (Standalone, no dependencies).
- [x] **Technical Specification**: Unified "UI + Product Spec Pack".
- [x] **Data Contract**: Canonical JSON schema for project portability.
- [x] **Visual Proof**: Screenshots of the working dashboard and creative studio mockups.

### 📈 Project Status Assessment
- **MVP Status**: **ON TRACK.** All core differentiating features are implemented and demonstrable.
- **Next Steps (Polish)**:
    - Enhance the "AFTER" preview with simulated waiting states (grayscale/darken).
    - Add a ComfyUI backend configuration modal for LAN/Localhost setup.
    - Final documentation sweep (README, Tech docs).
