EXAMPLE DIALOGUE TREE: Meeting the Dragon

NPC (Dragon): Who dares enter my domain?
- Player (Thorin): I am Thorin, seeker of lost treasures!
  - NPC: Foolish dwarf! You seek death.
    - Player: I am not afraid!
      - NPC: Then face your doom! [Combat initiates]
    - Player: Perhaps we can negotiate...
      - NPC: Negotiate? What do you offer?
        - Player: A share of the treasure.
          - NPC: Acceptable. What is your proposal? [Negotiation branch]
        - Player: Your life for my mercy.
          - NPC: Arrogant whelp! [Combat]
- Player (Thorin): I come in peace, ancient one.
  - NPC: Peace? From a dwarf bearing weapons?
    - Player: Weapons are for protection only.
      - NPC: Very well. State your purpose.
        - Player: I seek knowledge of the mountain.
          - NPC: Knowledge costs. What do you offer? [Quest branch]
        - Player: I seek to pass through.
          - NPC: The pass is dangerous. Prove your worth. [Challenge branch]
    - Player: Peace is my intent, not my guarantee.
      - NPC: Then leave before I change my mind. [End dialogue]
