Dialogue Scene: Thorin and the Wise Mentor

[Setting: A dimly lit tavern in a mountain village. THORIN sits at a wooden table, nursing a mug of ale. An elderly DWARF MENTOR enters and sits across from him.]

MENTOR
Thorin, my lad, I've seen that look in many eyes before. The mountains call to you, don't they? But beware the shadows that lurk in forgotten places.

THORIN
(leaning forward, eyes intense)
The stories of our ancestors speak of a great treasure, hidden in the heart of the Lonely Mountain. Dragons guard it, they say, but I am not afraid.

MENTOR
(shaking his head)
Bravery is not the absence of fear, boy. It's facing it head-on. But tell me, what drives you? Gold? Glory? Or something deeper?

THORIN
(pausing, his voice softening)
My people were driven from our homes. I seek to reclaim what was ours. For honor... and for my father, who never returned from that cursed mountain.

MENTOR
(nodding wisely)
Ah, now I see. The internal need for belonging. But remember, Thorin, even heroes have flaws. Your stubbornness may be your greatest strength... or your undoing.

THORIN
(rising, determined)
Then let it be my strength. I leave at dawn.

[Thorin exits. Mentor watches him go with a mixture of pride and concern.]
