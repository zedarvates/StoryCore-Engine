Title: The Lost Mountain

FADE IN:

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY

A rugged mountain pass winds through jagged peaks. THORIN, a brave and determined dwarf warrior, trudges along the path, his axe slung over his shoulder.

THORIN
(whispering to himself)
The ancient tales speak of treasures beyond imagination. But what price must we pay?

Suddenly, a shadow falls over him. He looks up to see a massive DRAGON perched on a cliff above.

DRAGON
(roaring)
Who dares enter my domain?

THORIN
(defiant)
I am Thorin, son of the mountains! I seek what was stolen from my people!

The dragon swoops down, breathing fire. Thorin rolls aside, his bravery shining through.

THORIN
(shouting)
For honor and glory!

CUT TO:

INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Thorin sits upon a reclaimed throne, the dragon's hoard at his feet. But his eyes show the internal conflict - the cost of victory.

THORIN
(to himself)
We won the mountain... but at what cost to our souls?

FADE OUT.
