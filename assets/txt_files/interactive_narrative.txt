THE MYSTERIOUS CAVE

You are Thorin, a brave dwarf explorer, standing at the entrance of a dark cave. Ancient runes warn of danger inside, but tales speak of great treasure. Your curiosity pulls you forward, but caution whispers to turn back.

What do you do?

CHOICE 1: Enter the cave bravely.
CHOICE 2: Look for another way in.
CHOICE 3: Turn back to the village.

[If you choose CHOICE 1: Enter bravely]

You step into the cave, your torch flickering against the walls. The air grows colder. Suddenly, you hear a low growl from the shadows.

What do you do?

CHOICE 1A: Stand your ground and call out.
CHOICE 1B: Hide behind a rock.
CHOICE 1C: Run back out.

[If you choose CHOICE 1A: Call out]

A massive bear emerges! But your brave stance impresses it. The bear sniffs you and leads you to a hidden chamber filled with gold.

ENDING: You become rich and legendary. The bear becomes your companion.

[If you choose CHOICE 1B: Hide]
