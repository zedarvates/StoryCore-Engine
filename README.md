## 🌟 A Message from the Creator

StoryCore is more than just a pipeline. It’s a system that lets you control ComfyUI or other tools through add‑ons. It helps you organize your entire workflow for video creation — from the written story, to the script, to the dialogue.

> "The future of the internet? And of cinema? It’s on‑demand videos built according to people’s tastes. According to each customer. Directly on their TV. Basically, it’s instant, made‑to‑order cinema."

I wanted to create a tool that modernizes long‑form video production without losing the soul of the craft. We start from the classic storyboard methods—the ones that shaped generations of creators—and we bring them into the present with the tools of our era.

**This isn't just another AI generator.** It's a complete production pipeline: storyboard, visual coherence, narrative continuity, scene organization, character tracking, location consistency. The system remembers the entire project, just like a full team dedicated to artistic supervision.

But above all, it **respects the creators**. The goal is not to replace artists, but to give them back time, freedom, and control. AI handles the repetitive tasks, while humans keep the vision, the emotion, and the direction.

And everything runs **locally**. Your data, your images, your scripts, your industrial secrets—everything stays on your machine. It's a sovereign tool, designed for studios, agencies, and independent creators who must protect their work.
