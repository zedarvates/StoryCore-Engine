Public Health Statistics Documentary Script

NARRATOR:
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths per year. This represents 32% of all global deaths.

Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past century. In 1900, the global average life expectancy was approximately 31 years. By 2020, it had risen to 72.6 years, representing an increase of more than 40 years in just over a century.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global mortality. According to WHO estimates, there were approximately 6.9 million confirmed deaths from COVID-19 worldwide between 2020 and 2023, though the actual toll is believed to be higher due to underreporting.

Vaccination programs have been one of the most successful public health interventions in history. The WHO estimates that vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, and measles.

Smallpox, once a devastating disease that killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone, was declared eradicated by the WHO in 1980 following a global vaccination campaign. This remains the only human disease to have been completely eradicated.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 38 million Americans have diabetes, representing about 11.6% of the U.S. population. Of these, about 90-95% have type 2 diabetes, which is largely preventable through lifestyle modifications.

The obesity rate in the United States has increased significantly over the past 50 years. In 1970, approximately 15% of American adults were obese. By 2020, this figure had risen to 42.4%, according to CDC data.

Mental health disorders affect a substantial portion of the global population. The WHO estimates that approximately 1 in 8 people worldwide live with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression being the most common conditions.

Antibiotic resistance is an growing public health threat. The CDC estimates that in the United States alone, at least 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths.

According to the American Cancer Society, the overall cancer death rate in the United States has declined by 32% from its peak in 1991 to 2019, translating to approximately 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if rates had remained at their peak.

Smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death. The WHO estimates that tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year, including approximately 1.2 million non-smokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke.

The global maternal mortality ratio has declined by approximately 38% between 2000 and 2017, from 342 deaths per 100,000 live births to 211 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to WHO data.

Child mortality has also seen dramatic improvements. In 1990, the global under-five mortality rate was 93 deaths per 1,000 live births. By 2020, this had fallen to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births, representing a 60% reduction.

Access to clean water has improved significantly. In 2000, approximately 82% of the global population had access to at least basic drinking water services. By 2020, this figure had increased to 74% with access to safely managed drinking water services.

The global HIV/AIDS epidemic has seen significant progress. According to UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections has declined by 52% since the peak in 1997, from 2.9 million to 1.5 million in 2020.
