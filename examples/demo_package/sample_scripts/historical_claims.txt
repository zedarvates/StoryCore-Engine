Ancient Civilizations Documentary Script

NARRATOR:
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu, stands as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years, reaching an original height of 146.5 meters (481 feet).

The pyramid was constructed using approximately 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons. Some of the granite blocks used in the King's Chamber weigh as much as 80 tons. The precision of the construction is remarkable - the base of the pyramid is level to within just 2.1 centimeters.

Ancient Egyptian workers used copper tools and wooden sledges to move these massive stones. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the workers were not slaves, as commonly believed, but rather paid laborers who lived in nearby workers' villages. Excavations have revealed bakeries, breweries, and medical facilities that served these communities.

The Library of Alexandria, founded around 300 BCE by Ptolemy I Soter, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. It is estimated to have contained between 40,000 and 400,000 scrolls at its height. The exact number remains uncertain due to conflicting historical accounts.

The library was destroyed in a series of events over several centuries. A significant fire occurred in 48 BCE during Julius Caesar's civil war, though the extent of the damage is debated among historians. The library continued to function in some capacity until at least 260 CE.

The Roman Colosseum, completed in 80 CE under Emperor Titus, could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators. It was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building was constructed using an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of travertine stone.

The Colosseum featured a complex system of underground tunnels and chambers called the hypogeum, where gladiators and animals were kept before contests. Elevators and pulleys were used to raise them to the arena floor. The building also had a retractable awning system called the velarium to provide shade for spectators.

The Mayan civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica from around 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, developed one of the most sophisticated writing systems in the pre-Columbian Americas. They also made significant advances in mathematics, including the independent development of the concept of zero around 350 CE.

The Mayan calendar system was remarkably accurate. Their solar calendar, called the Haab, consisted of 365 days, while their ritual calendar, the Tzolkin, had 260 days. These two calendars worked together in a 52-year cycle called the Calendar Round.

The city of Teotihuacan, located in central Mexico, was one of the largest cities in the ancient world, with a population estimated at 125,000 to 200,000 at its peak around 450 CE. The Pyramid of the Sun, one of the largest structures in Mesoamerica, rises to a height of 65 meters (213 feet).

The Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting East and West, operated from approximately 130 BCE to 1453 CE. It facilitated not only the exchange of goods like silk, spices, and precious metals, but also the spread of ideas, technologies, and religions across Eurasia.
