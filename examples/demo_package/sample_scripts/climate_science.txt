Climate Science Documentary Script

NARRATOR:
The Earth's climate has been changing throughout its 4.5 billion year history. However, the current rate of warming is unprecedented in the geological record. Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased by approximately 50%, rising from 280 parts per million to over 420 parts per million today.

The greenhouse effect, first described by Joseph Fourier in 1824, is a natural process that keeps our planet warm enough to support life. Without it, Earth's average temperature would be about -18 degrees Celsius instead of the current 15 degrees Celsius. However, human activities have intensified this effect.

According to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the global average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. The majority of this warming has occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest on record.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established in 1988, represents the consensus of thousands of scientists worldwide. Their 2021 report concluded with high confidence that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.

Ice core data from Antarctica, spanning 800,000 years, shows that current CO2 levels are higher than at any point in that record. The rate of increase is also unprecedented - what took nature thousands of years to accomplish, humans have done in just over a century.

Sea levels have risen by about 8-9 inches (21-24 centimeters) since 1880, with about a third of that occurring in just the last 25 years. The rate of sea level rise is accelerating, currently at about 3.4 millimeters per year.

Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of approximately 13% per decade relative to the 1981-2010 average. Some climate models predict that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer by 2040 if current trends continue.

The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which has led to a 30% increase in ocean acidity since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This process, known as ocean acidification, threatens marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.

Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing.

Scientists estimate that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change compared to 2 degrees Celsius or higher. This target was established in the Paris Agreement of 2015, signed by 196 parties.
