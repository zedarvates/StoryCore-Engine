News Interview Transcript - Economic Policy Discussion

[00:00:00] ANCHOR: Welcome back to Evening News. Tonight we're discussing the new economic policy with Senator Johnson. Senator, thank you for joining us.

[00:00:15] SENATOR: Thank you for having me. It's crucial that the American people understand what's really at stake here.

[00:00:22] ANCHOR: Let's start with the proposed tax changes. Can you explain the key provisions?

[00:00:28] SENATOR: Well, first of all, let me be clear - this policy is a disaster waiting to happen. Everyone knows that raising taxes has never worked in the history of our country. Never. Not once.

[00:00:42] ANCHOR: But Senator, there have been periods of economic growth during times of higher tax rates, haven't there?

[00:00:48] SENATOR: That's what they want you to believe. But the real experts, the people who actually understand economics, they all agree with me. Every single one of them. This is just common sense.

[00:01:02] ANCHOR: Can you cite specific economists who support your position?

[00:01:06] SENATOR: Look, I don't need to cite anyone. The facts speak for themselves. Our opponents are trying to destroy the middle class. That's their goal. They wake up every morning thinking about how to hurt working families.

[00:01:20] ANCHOR: That's a strong accusation. Do you have evidence that-

[00:01:24] SENATOR: Evidence? Just look at what happened last time they were in power. The economy was in shambles. Unemployment was at record highs. Crime was everywhere. People couldn't even leave their houses.

[00:01:38] ANCHOR: Actually, the unemployment rate during that period was-

[00:01:42] SENATOR: And another thing - they're not telling you about the secret provisions in this bill. There are things hidden in there that would shock the American people. Things they don't want you to know about.

[00:01:54] ANCHOR: What specific provisions are you referring to?

[00:01:58] SENATOR: I can't get into all the details right now, but trust me, it's bad. Very bad. The worst policy I've seen in my 30 years in politics. And I've seen a lot of bad policies.

[00:02:10] ANCHOR: Let's talk about the projected impact on the deficit. Independent analysts suggest-

[00:02:16] SENATOR: Independent? There's no such thing as independent analysts anymore. They're all bought and paid for by special interests. Follow the money, that's what I always say.

[00:02:28] ANCHOR: The Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, has released estimates showing-

[00:02:34] SENATOR: The CBO? Please. They've been wrong about everything for the past decade. Nobody takes them seriously anymore. Real Americans know better than to trust these so-called experts.

[00:02:46] ANCHOR: Senator, I have to push back on that. The CBO has a track record of-

[00:02:51] SENATOR: You know what? This is exactly the problem with the media today. You're more interested in defending failed institutions than in telling the truth. The American people see right through this.

[00:03:04] ANCHOR: I'm simply trying to present factual information-

[00:03:08] SENATOR: Facts? Let me tell you about facts. The fact is that this policy will destroy jobs. Millions of jobs. Maybe tens of millions. Some people are saying it could be even more than that.

[00:03:22] ANCHOR: Can you provide a source for those job loss projections?

[00:03:26] SENATOR: I don't need to provide sources. Everyone knows this. It's obvious to anyone with common sense. If you can't see it, then you're part of the problem.

[00:03:36] ANCHOR: Senator Johnson, thank you for your time.

[00:03:40] SENATOR: Remember, folks - don't believe what they tell you. Believe what you see with your own eyes. This policy is a disaster, and history will prove me right.

[00:03:50] ANCHOR: That was Senator Johnson discussing the proposed economic policy. We'll be right back after this break.
